Welcome to Green-Foot!

We are Team PowerPuffs. For our project this semester, we decided to work on a NASA project - Group 4. We used 3 principles while conducting our project - Exploring, Discovering, Defining. 
We explored data describing environmental elements. We discovered the relationship between these locations and if the could host a renewable energy plant. We defined new places and 
opportunities for renewable energy sources. Our goals during our project was to create an educational website that helps users explore data. It allows them to filter data and make searches.
We also created a map feature which would allow users to view specific location as a graphic visualization. Our website also allows users to create an account so they can save and 
download their results. The download feature allows users to save the data in a json and csv format. The stakeholders for our website would be scientists, researchers, students, or even the
general public. The technologies we used during our project was Node, Express, React, and MongoDB. The API text file further lists all the endpoints we created for the project
and discuesses specific features our website has. We really loved working on this project this semester!
