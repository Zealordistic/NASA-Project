For Lab 4, we created a game where the user uses the sliders to try to guess the color. To start, they enter their name 
and the number of seconds they want for the guess. Once they submit, they can start to guess and the timer starts to count 
down. After every guess, the score (based on given formula) is calculated and added to the old score. We faced some problems 
while working on this lab. For example, getting all the components to work like the timer and the slider. It was a challenge 
to connect all the components to get it to work with each other. Also, we aren't sure if the score is being calculated correctly. 
Once the score is calculated, it overwrites the time so we don't know how many seconds are left and the user can keep guessing 
and adding onto their score. Another issue was that the user is only allowed to play one round. To change the color, they have 
to refresh the page and enter the information again. To fix this, if we had more time, we would create a refresh button to change
the color so the user doesn't have to re-enter their information each time. Our major issues involved gitignore not working properly 
and having some issues with node module folder kin our github desktop. Other than that, our lab meets the requirements. Our creativity
was demonstrated through the components we created like the slider, user guess, and timer.
